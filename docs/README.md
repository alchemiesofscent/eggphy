## About This Dataset

This dataset contains ~85 historical recipes claiming you can write on an eggshell with alum and vinegar such that, when boiled, the inscription appears on the egg white. Despite repeated modern failures (ordinary potassium alum does not work), this "zombie recipe" persisted for nearly two millennia across cultures and languages.

### üìö Historical Significance

- **Time Span**: 1000 CE to 2025 CE (spanning Byzantine, Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern periods)
- **Languages**: Greek, Latin, German, French, Italian, English, and others
- **Sources**: Agricultural manuals, magic texts, household guides, entertainment books, and internet forums
- **Cultural Transmission**: Tracks how technical knowledge spreads and evolves across cultures

### üî¨ Research Applications

This dataset is valuable for researchers studying:
- **Historical Technology Transfer**: How technical recipes spread between cultures
- **Textual Transmission**: Patterns of copying, adaptation, and contamination
- **Science Communication**: Evolution of technical instructions over time
- **Digital Humanities**: Computational analysis of historical texts
- **Phylogenetics**: Applying biological evolution models to cultural transmission

## üèõÔ∏è Research Context

### Why Study "Failed" Recipes?

1. **Transmission Mechanisms**: How do instructions spread without experimental verification?
2. **Cultural Authority**: What makes people trust and copy technical claims?
3. **Textual Evolution**: How do copying errors and adaptations accumulate?
4. **Cross-Cultural Exchange**: How do recipes adapt to local materials and practices?

### Methodology

This research combines:
- **Classical Stemmatology**: Traditional manuscript analysis techniques
- **Computational Phylogenetics**: Biological evolution models applied to texts
- **Digital Humanities**: Large-scale text analysis and visualization
- **Historical Chemistry**: Understanding period materials and processes
