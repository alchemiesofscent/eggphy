Even though della Porta was enthusiastic about using an egg for secret writing, it has been very hard to get this kitchen experiment to work. He recommends using alum and vinegar as the invisible substance with which you write on the egg. This secret egg experiment has been handed down in history for hundreds of years. Supposedly French peasants used it during World War I. In 1965 the New York Times announced that the Department of Agriculture was encouraging children to write secret messages on eggs with alum and vinegar in order to entice them to eat more eggs. As late as 2012, the secretwriting egg was still frequently featured on the Internet. When Jason Lye, a color chemist, and I wrote to ask why our experiment didn’t work, we got no reply. I’ve tried this experiment numerous times with my students and in preparation for demonstrations at talks. It doesn’t work! I’ve tried writing on the egg with store-bought alum and vinegar using both a boiled and a raw egg. It never works. It’s hard to believe that this recipe has been handed down for almost five hundred years and it doesn’t work. We have failed to perform an “errand of deception” with a secret-writing egg.  Della Porta advised writing on an egg because the Inquisition wouldn’t find it suspicious, but individuals who clashed with church or state weren’t the only ones interested in developing invisible ink. The rise of modern diplomacy in Italy led to a practical need for coded messages, and offices employing cipher secretaries sprang up in the city-states. In this atmosphere of intrigue and secrecy new ciphers proliferated. Cryptology and secret writing flourished. Cipher secretaries and manuals on cryptography proliferated. [p.311] Hard-Boiled Egg Secret Messages. Phoo! Has anyone out there ever gotten this one to work? As you may recall, della Porta recommended using hard-boiled eggs to smuggle secret messages out of prison during the Inquisition. Evidently, messages were written on the shells with vinegar and alum as an ink. Supposedly, once the egg was peeled, the message could be read on the surface of the cooked egg. (We’ve tried writing on a raw eggshell, which we then boiled, with no success.) With the eighth saucepan of eggs boiling away on the stove, the kitchen all steamed up, and eggshell crumbs crunching under our feet, we have tried all kinds of variations on this experiment, without success. Assuming it’s not a complete myth, it seems as though some details of this secret-writing technique have been lost over the years. Also surprising is the number of references to the story that repeat the same incorrect procedural information almost verbatim— apparently without the authors’ having confirmed that it works.

How it looks: Pass a secret message to your friend using this trick. On the outside, the egg looks like any other egg. When the egg is peeled however, a message is remarkably written on the egg inside. What you need: • 1 hard-cooked egg (see instructions for hard-cooking an egg below) • Alum (1 tbsp or 15 mL) (Alum is commonly found at most grocery stores where spices are found.) • White vinegar (2 cups or 500 mL) • Fine-tipped paintbrush, toothpick or Q-tip • Spoon • Adult helper Preparation: Hard-cook one egg.

From an early age, he was encouraged to acquire knowledge. This meant, firstly, a tour of Europe, with a particular emphasis on acquiring musical skills. Upon his return to the sun-drenched Bay of Naples, aged twenty-two, he began work on the first of many books; this one being Natural Magic, which despite the title was less to do with magic than with ‘the perfection of natural philosophy and the highest science’. He introduced it by explaining that ‘if ever any man laboured earnestly to discover the secrets of Nature, it was I; for with all my mind and power, I have turned over the monuments of our ancestors and if they wrote anything that was secret and concealed, that I enrolled in my catalogue of rarities’. These ‘secrets’ included ‘Of the Causes of Wonderful Things’, ‘Of Beautifying Women’, ‘Of Strange Glasses’, ‘Of Artificial Fires’ and ‘Of Invisible Writing’. His first rather startling entrance into codebreaking was his adaptation of a dairy-based ruse he attributed to a second century Libyan scholar called Africanus and it involved smuggling messages to prisoners via eggs. This might sound whimsical, but this was still the time of the Inquisition, and to be suspected of heresy could be hideously dangerous. Secret messages that made it past the most intensive searches could be life-saving for many prisoners kept in dungeons. But how to avoid this stringent security? The method: write the message, using alum or plant dye, onto the shell of an egg. When the egg is dry, hard-boil it and the message on the shell will disappear. The egg could then be taken into the prison in a package of food. When it arrived, all the recipient had to do was peel the shell and they would find the message there, indelibly imprinted onto the boiled egg white.",,witnesses_flat

Just make sure you do not botch up the message while writing so use a fine brush or even toothpick. After writing message on eggs dry them out completely. Drying the eggs completely is very important because otherwise the chances of the message of being washed out are quite high. You have to inscribe message on egg, so now the final step is to hard boil the egg. It is not a very difficult task and can be done easily by anyone. Just put the egg in water and bring it to boil for about 15-20 mins. The egg should be hard boiled by then. Just take it out carefully and let it cool.

Purpose of the Illustration To show how Christ can put messages upon the hearts of His children. To indicate how He can change the heart and give it a living message. To show how Christ can give us new hearts. Apparatus Several fresh eggs, according to the number of messages you wish to write, or objects you wish to draw. A bottle to contain your writing fluid. A pen or stubby instrument with which to write or draw. Some means by which you can boil the eggs before the audience. This may be an electric stove or canned heat. The experiment is more effective if the audience can see it in its entirety. Hence you should boil the eggs before them. Chemicals A half pint of vinegar. An ounce of alum. Method of Procedure Dissolve the alum in the vinegar, which is your writing fluid. Select only fresh and not storage eggs on which to write the various messages, or draw objects, such as a heart, a book, etc. Write such words as God Is Love, Jesus Saves, Salvation by Faith, The Cleansing Blood, Bible, and short Bible verses. Then there may be occasions when you will wish to slant this message toward sinners, and write words such as Cigarettes, Beer, Dance, etc., and draw pictures to suit those words. With the writing fluid you have prepared write on each egg in view of the audience. It is well to cover the egg with writing. Make the writing as legible as possible. Boil the eggs fifteen minutes. Remove the shells and hold the eggs so that the audience can see them. You may wish to pass the eggs around on a platter, or call several young people or children from the audience to read the messages which appear on the boiled eggs. Chemical Reactions The writing is invisible on the outside of the Boiling transfers the messages to the inner surface of the hard-boiled egg, where it is visible. Cautions and Representations Do not smear your letters. To do so means a blurred message. Practice the experiment at home until you learn just how to use the solution so it will not run. Be sure that your writing solution is thoroughly dried on the eggs before boiling them. The egg represents a life or a heart which Christ can change and write His living messages upon. These messages may be invisible to others, but they are living and flaming within the heart of the converted person. Russia used this trick to get messages out of forbidden sections during the early days of the revolution. Soviet agents took fresh eggs, wrote the messages which they wished to send upon the eggs, and then shipped them in crates out of the country to the central agent. ""When boiled the eggs revealed the secret messages. Often this was done in code, so if the trick was exposed, the messages were unintelligible to those who exposed them. Christ has a message which He wants to write upon our hearts. Salvation is primarily a change of heart, and this change brings the written statutes of Christ upon the heart. He places His messages invisibly upon the inner nature, and while others may not be able to see or read or understand them, they are a living force in the life of the Christian. Since it takes fifteen minutes to boil the eggs you should begin the experiment as soon as you start to talk. On these eggs I am writing an invisible message. As you write the messages call somebody from the audience to inspect the eggs to see if there is any evidence of your writing. There is nothing on the surface of the eggs, is there? Apparently they are ordinary eggs, some brown, some white, some double-yolked (if you are lucky enough to find one!), some large, some small. When Christ comes in He writes a message upon the heart. Salvation is a heart-experience, and while it cleans up the outer life it works this marvelous change by altering the inner nature. When Christ converts us, He writes His statutes upon our hearts and puts a new spirit within us through the forgiveness of our sins. Only forgiven people, cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, have this experience. Remove the shells from the egg and read the messages. Here are the results of my writing upon the eggs. This represents the way Christ through the Holy Spirit writes messages upon the hearts of His children. The messages are plainly evident. How did they get there? I wrote them on the outside, but they developed on the inside. So it is that Christ, when He has given us a new heart through the cleansing of His precious blood, writes on the heart living messages that will cause us to walk in His statutes, and then we ""shall keep (His)  judgments, and do them.""","moreillustrations.com archive, accessed 2010 Feb 9",witnesses_flat
