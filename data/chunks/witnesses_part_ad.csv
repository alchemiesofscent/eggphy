One really interesting method: Was to use an egg for the message. Which could easily be slipped to the other Witch, with in a basket of eggs at the marketplace. The Egg should be hard boiled at least 5 minutes; and cooled.  Dissolve as much alum as you can in a tablespoon of vinegar.  Alum is found in the pharmacy or in the grocery store with pickling supplies. Use this solution to write on the eggshell using a piece of straw from a broom, a toothpick, or a small brush. Once the egg is dry, it looks perfectly normal. When the shell is removed, the writing is visible on the egg's surface.

Pass a secret message to your friend using this trick. On the outside, the egg looks like any other egg. When the egg is peeled however, a message is remarkably written on the egg inside. 1 hard-cooked egg (see instructions for hard-cooking an egg below) Alum (1 tbsp or 15 mL) (Alum is commonly found at most grocery stores where spices are found.) White vinegar (2 cups or 500 mL) Fine-tipped paintbrush, toothpick or Q-tip Spoon Place cold eggs in a single layer in a saucepan (picture A). Cover with at least 2.5 cm (1-inch) cold water over top of the eggs. Cover saucepan and bring quickly to a boil over high heat. Immediately remove pan from heat to stop boiling. Keep lid on.

Fun with Grandchildren,Modern Internet / DIY / Blogs,,Experiment blog post with grandchildren,Multiple ratios of alum and vinegar tested; reports failure,"A dozen boiled eggs with lion marks visible in a saucepan. (Photo credit: Wikipedia) Maybe it’s because they are brown. Maybe it’s because they are fresh from the farmer. I’ve found eggs take a lot longer to boil when they are really fresh, something I learned when we kept chickens in our front yard for about eight years. So, the shells of very fresh eggs might be too strong for this experiment. Whatever it is, I could not get today’s experiment to work. Do You Test All Your Experiments? I test about three-quarters of the experiments I write about. I look for activities that will be fun with and for grandchildren that meet several criteria: They are fun They take 5-10 minutes to complete You can do them with materials you are likely to have around the house They have some educational underpinning Instructions are clear and precise. If it is something simple, like lining up buttons in a pattern or stacking sugar cubes, I do not do it myself. I just write about it. If, however, I’m not sure if it will work as described, I try it out myself. If it doesn’t work, I look up the concept on the Internet to see if anyone else has a different way that might work. If not, I abandon the activity and look for something else. Freezing water instantly turned out to take a special chemical that only a few sites mentioned. It was not a chemical you would likely have around your house. Getting an oatmeal box to roll with weights suspended inside just never worked. Back To The Eggs and Invisible Writing. This time, I’m writing about it because I think the idea is really cool. I challenge my readers to tell me if they’ve ever tried it, if it worked and what kind of eggs they used.  Here are the three ways I tried, the first from wackyuses.com:  Equal Parts Alum and White Vinegar/Boil Egg First Materials: Small bowl Measuring cup Alum White vinegar Q-tips cotton swabs Hard-boiled egg Instructions: Dissolve one part alum in one part vinegar. I used 1 tablespoon of each. Mix alum and vinegar well. Dip one of the Q-tips in the alum-vinegar solution. Write something on the eggshell with the wet Q-tip. Let the alum-vinegar solution dry on the eggshell. Peel the egg. What Should Happen? The vinegar should dissolve some of the eggshell, allowing the alum through to mark the egg white inside with your message. I got nothing, no secret message, but the egg was delicious. Bizarrelabs described the experiment and said sometimes it didn’t work.  Next: Diluted Alum and White Vinegar/Boil Egg First Eggs.ab.ca gave a different ratio for the alum and vinegar. Materials: Hard-cooked egg 1 Tablespoon alum 2 cups white vinegar Fine-tipped paintbrush, toothpick or Q-tip. Instructions: Hard boil egg; allow to cool Stir alum into vinegar. Dip brush, toothpick or Q-tip into the solution and write on the egg When the egg is later peeled, the message will appear. This site had the same explanation of what is supposed to be happening. The vinegar dissolves the calcium carbonate in the eggshell, allowing the alum to go through (permeate) the shell and discolor the egg white. It also did not work. This site also said you should not eat the egg because alum is no longer considered safe for pickling. It used to be a common ingredient for pickling and that is why you will find  it in the baking section of the grocery store, with other spices. The pickles-and-spices.com site says alum is still approved as a food additive by FDA. But, it can be dangerous in amounts over an ounce and should not be inhaled. It is slowly being withdrawn from use. Write Before Boiling Two sites said to write the secret message before hard boiling the eggs. The Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reprinted a suggestion one of their readers sent in. Using the same diluted alum and vinegar solution to paint on the egg, they suggest waiting several hours after painting the message before boiling the egg. I waited about two hours. No luck. The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card & Magic Tricks, excerpted in Google books, says to write the name of a card on the egg with the diluted alum-vinegar solution, then boil the egg. Then, arrange to have someone pick that card out of a deck through a magic trick explained elsewhere in the book, crack open the egg and reveal the name of the card they are holding. Now, that would be an impressive trick. Have you ever heard of this secret message inside an egg trick? Have you ever tried it? What kind of eggs did you use? To you and sharing magic with your grandchildren.","newgrandmas.com article, accessed 2012 Aug 15",witnesses_flat

Make ""X's"" and ""O's"", paint stripes or write someone's name on the eggshells before cooking the eggs. Use a solution of ½ pint vinegar and 1 ounce alum. Dip a small pointed brush in the alum-vinegar solution and write names or designs on the eggshells. Let the solution dry several hours so the message soaks through the eggshell and onto the white. Then cook the eggs, and cool them. When you peel the shell off, a readable gray message will appear on the white of what will become the stuffed deviled egg. Note: Alum is a crystalline powder, a general-purpose food additive that functions as a firming agent for pickles. You'll find McCormick brand alum among the spices at the grocery store.","Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 30-Mar-2010, accessed 2010 Apr 03",witnesses_flat

Some of his friends were imprisoned by the Inquisition. At the gate of the prison, everything was checked except for eggs. Della Porta wrote messages on the eggshell using a mixture made of plant pigments and alum. The ink penetrated the eggshell which is semi-porous. When the eggshell was dry, he boiled the egg in hot water and the ink on the outside of the egg was washed away. When the recipient in prison peeled off the shell, the message was revealed once again on the egg white.","Wikipedia entry, accessed 2025 Apr 01, citing circular source (Philalethe Reveal’d Vol. 2)",witnesses_flat

Note: At the end, throw the egg away. Don’t allow anyone to eat it.","This is a simple trick with a very novel means of disclosure — an egg! It is particularly effective with a young audience. Effect: A spectator cuts the pack, remembers a chosen card, and then shuffletsh e card back into the pack. The spectator then shells a previously inspected hard-boiled egg and discovers the name of the chosen card is written on the egg white! Equipment You will need an ordinary pack of playing cards, a fresh egg, half an ounce (15g) of alum (potassium alum), half a pint (300ml) of vinegar, a wooden cocktail stick, a spoon, a saucepan of water and a stove ring. You will need adult supervision when boiling the egg. Preparation: Dissolve the alum (potassium alum) in the vinegar. Write the name of a card (the one you will force) on the eggshell using the cocktail stick dipped in the alum solution. Place this card at the bottom of the pack. When the writing is dry and invisible, boil the egg for 12-15 minutes. Remove the egg from the saucepan with a spoon and allow the egg to cool. It is now ready to use. Throw away the unused solution and thoroughly clean and rinse your hands and the equipment you used. The trick uses the technique in The Cut Force (see p. 128) and the false overhand shuffle (see p. 12). Performing Begin by explaining: “This is one of my most unusual tricks. Have a good look at this hard-boiled egg.” Pass the egg to a spectator to examine carefully. Take back the egg and put it safely to one side. Continue: “Now throughout the trick I want you to keep one eye on the egg.” Shuffle the pack using the false overhand shuffle that keeps the bottom card in place. Get a spectator to cut the cards and put the lower pile crossways on the upper pile. As he does this, say: “Don’t forget to keep an eye on the egg.” Ask the spectator to pick up the top pile, look at and remember the bottom card, and then place the pile on top of the other cards and shuffle the pack thoroughly. Get the spectator to put the pack to one side and then concentrate hard on a mental image of the card he has chosen. As he is doing this, take the egg and pass your hand back and forth over the egg, concentrating hard with your eyes shut. Finish with: “Yes, I think I’ve done it.” Pass the egg to the spectator and ask him to carefully remove the shell. On the egg white will be the name of his card (1)! Note: At the end, throw the egg away. Don’t allow anyone to eat it.",,witnesses_flat
