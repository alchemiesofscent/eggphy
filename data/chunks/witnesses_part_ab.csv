Not long ago I saw the egg of a domestic hen boiled, and when cracked and opened, the following words and figures appeared, perfectly printed on the white of the egg: “War will come in 1932.” As I am a disbeliever in hokum and bunk, I would appreciate information on how this was done? ANS. This sounds like an old hex trick. You can write on the inside of an egg by dissolving 1 ounce of alum in ½ pint of vinegar. With a small pointed brush, outline whatever writing you desire on the shell of the egg with this solution. After the writing has dried thoroughly, boil the egg for 15 minutes. All trace of writing should disappear from the shell, and when the egg is cracked and shelled, the writing will appear on the hard-boiled white.",,witnesses_flat

Place the egg in water and boil for about fifteen minutes. The lettering on the shell will disappear, but on removing the shell, the prophecy will be seen on the hard-boiled white of the egg. By serving hard-boiled eggs thus prepared, you can cause much curiosity and excitement among your friends, especially if some startling prophecy is used.",,witnesses_flat

The message will be on the hard-cooked egg white. To make the “magic ink,” dissolve one ounce of alum (available in drugstores) in one cup of vinegar. Use a small pointed brush to write on the shell.

Eggs figure more than once in the spy records of Europe. There was one case of a lady who lived in France, but only a mile or two away from the Swiss frontier: legitimately enough, she used to have her eggs sent from a Swiss farm—in times of peace, movement over friendly frontiers is easy enough, and, a frontier being an artificial line, it is quite natural that local people should move freely from one side to the other. Unfortunately for the lady, the French counter-espionage service grew suspicious. She had done nothing to excite their curiosity, but a French agent in Switzerland had discovered that the Swiss farmer was a German whose activities had been known in another connection some years before. For weeks, however, they were unable to discover any illicit intercourse—except for the consignment of eggs and payment for them, there seemed to be no communication. The cartons in which the eggs were delivered were examined by French agents. At last, in despair, it was decided to examine the eggs themselves. Within a few hours laboratory tests had revealed their secret, for when they were dipped in a certain solution of gallnut, writing was disclosed on their shells; the ink was identified as a preparation of thiol-gall. Yet this method was primitive compared with another across which I have chanced on more than one occasion. I can still recall the amazement of a veteran counter-espionage officer when, peeling the shell from a hard-boiled egg, he noticed hieroglyphics in black on the white of the egg, which eventually deciphered themselves into letters. Yet the device is simple enough—and for that matter by no means modern. [recipe] After the egg is hard-boiled and has been allowed to cool, the spy sets a small portion of alum and vinegar—but, it will be noted, homely articles arousing no suspicion. The alum is the more unusual, but a spy can legitimately carry an antiseptic block with which to rub his chin when he cuts himself while shaving. The alum and vinegar are mixed together to the consistency of ink; then the message is written on the outside of the shell. As this unique invisible ink dries, there is nothing to be seen; but a few hours later the message (which must be written in large characters) will appear on the white of the egg. A chemist friend of mine has given me an explanation of this apparently remarkable phenomenon. There is, of course, iron in alum—ferrous ammonium sulphate: commercial vinegar (acetic acid) is just strong enough to perforate the egg shell (calcium carbonate) carrying with it a little iron in solution. After the acid has eaten through the shell, it reaches the white of the egg. This contains sulphur—as you will have remarked when smelling a bad egg: the sulphur combines with the iron in solution to form iron sulphide, which is black. [/recipe]",,witnesses_flat
