Boil the egg until it hardens, and coat it with wax, and carve letters into the wax with a stylus so that the incisions open. Place it in a liquid, that is made from galls ground with alum. Then put it in sharp vinegar, and the letters become permeable, which you will see, once the shell has been removed, on the egg white. [w3b] Africanus teaches thus: ‘grind galls and alum with vinegar, until they have the viscosity of ink. With it, inscribe whatever your want on the egg and once the writing has been dried by the sun, place the egg in sharp brine. Once it is dry, cook it, peel, and you will find the inscription.’ I put it in vinegar and nothing happened, unless by ‘brine’, he meant sharp lye, normally called capitellum. The reason for this is the following: the shell of the egg is porous and gapes with loose pores, as is shown by the fact that a freshly heated egg sweats and exudes moisture outward, and when held against the light, the pores appear clearly. And since the vinegar, being subtle, penetrates through these pores and softens the shell, and since it is mixed with alum and gall, it leaves behind their substance and imprints it upon the albumen of the egg; and when you then immerse it in cold water, it hardens and returns to its former state. But it should be noted that one must not leave the egg too long in vinegar: for it eats away the entire shell, leaving the egg bare, covered only by its membrane; and if you immerse such an egg in water, the shell does not regenerate."

Eggs figure more than once in the spy records of Europe. There was one case of a lady who lived in France, but only a mile or two away from the Swiss frontier: legitimately enough, she used to have her eggs sent from a Swiss farm—in times of peace, movement over friendly frontiers is easy enough, and, a frontier being an artificial line, it is quite natural that local people should move freely from one side to the other. Unfortunately for the lady, the French counter-espionage service grew suspicious. She had done nothing to excite their curiosity, but a French agent in Switzerland had discovered that the Swiss farmer was a German whose activities had been known in another connection some years before. For weeks, however, they were unable to discover any illicit intercourse—except for the consignment of eggs and payment for them, there seemed to be no communication. The cartons in which the eggs were delivered were examined by French agents. At last, in despair, it was decided to examine the eggs themselves. Within a few hours laboratory tests had revealed their secret, for when they were dipped in a certain solution of gallnut, writing was disclosed on their shells; the ink was identified as a preparation of thiol-gall. Yet this method was primitive compared with another across which I have chanced on more than one occasion. I can still recall the amazement of a veteran counter-espionage officer when, peeling the shell from a hard-boiled egg, he noticed hieroglyphics in black on the white of the egg, which eventually deciphered themselves into letters. Yet the device is simple enough—and for that matter by no means modern. [recipe] After the egg is hard-boiled and has been allowed to cool, the spy sets a small portion of alum and vinegar—but, it will be noted, homely articles arousing no suspicion. The alum is the more unusual, but a spy can legitimately carry an antiseptic block with which to rub his chin when he cuts himself while shaving. The alum and vinegar are mixed together to the consistency of ink; then the message is written on the outside of the shell. As this unique invisible ink dries, there is nothing to be seen; but a few hours later the message (which must be written in large characters) will appear on the white of the egg. A chemist friend of mine has given me an explanation of this apparently remarkable phenomenon. There is, of course, iron in alum—ferrous ammonium sulphate: commercial vinegar (acetic acid) is just strong enough to perforate the egg shell (calcium carbonate) carrying with it a little iron in solution. After the acid has eaten through the shell, it reaches the white of the egg. This contains sulphur—as you will have remarked when smelling a bad egg: the sulphur combines with the iron in solution to form iron sulphide, which is black.

Even though della Porta was enthusiastic about using an egg for secret writing, it has been very hard to get this kitchen experiment to work. He recommends using alum and vinegar as the invisible substance with which you write on the egg. This secret egg experiment has been handed down in history for hundreds of years. Supposedly French peasants used it during World War I. In 1965 the New York Times announced that the Department of Agriculture was encouraging children to write secret messages on eggs with alum and vinegar in order to entice them to eat more eggs. As late as 2012, the secretwriting egg was still frequently featured on the Internet. When Jason Lye, a color chemist, and I wrote to ask why our experiment didn’t work, we got no reply. I’ve tried this experiment numerous times with my students and in preparation for demonstrations at talks. It doesn’t work! I’ve tried writing on the egg with store-bought alum and vinegar using both a boiled and a raw egg. It never works. It’s hard to believe that this recipe has been handed down for almost five hundred years and it doesn’t work. We have failed to perform an “errand of deception” with a secret-writing egg.  Della Porta advised writing on an egg because the Inquisition wouldn’t find it suspicious, but individuals who clashed with church or state weren’t the only ones interested in developing invisible ink. The rise of modern diplomacy in Italy led to a practical need for coded messages, and offices employing cipher secretaries sprang up in the city-states. In this atmosphere of intrigue and secrecy new ciphers proliferated. Cryptology and secret writing flourished. Cipher secretaries and manuals on cryptography proliferated. [p.311] Hard-Boiled Egg Secret Messages. Phoo! Has anyone out there ever gotten this one to work? As you may recall, della Porta recommended using hard-boiled eggs to smuggle secret messages out of prison during the Inquisition. Evidently, messages were written on the shells with vinegar and alum as an ink. Supposedly, once the egg was peeled, the message could be read on the surface of the cooked egg. (We’ve tried writing on a raw eggshell, which we then boiled, with no success.) With the eighth saucepan of eggs boiling away on the stove, the kitchen all steamed up, and eggshell crumbs crunching under our feet, we have tried all kinds of variations on this experiment, without success. Assuming it’s not a complete myth, it seems as though some details of this secret-writing technique have been lost over the years. Also surprising is the number of references to the story that repeat the same incorrect procedural information almost verbatim— apparently without the authors’ having confirmed that it works.

WHAT YOU NEED » Small bowl
» Measuring cup
» Alum (can find in the spice aisle at your local supermarket)
» White vinegar
» Q-tips
» Hard-boiled egg
WHAT TO DO
In the bowl, dissolve one part alum in one part vinegar. Mix well. Use the Q-tips cotton swab to write or draw something on the eggshell using the alum and vinegar solution as ink. Let dry. Remove the eggshell from the egg.
WHAT HAPPENS
The alum-and-vinegar solution dries invisible, but when the eggshell is removed the writing is visible on the egg’s surface (the egg is still edible).
WHY IT HAPPENS
The vinegar (acetic acid) dissolved the calcium carbonate in the eggshell, allowing the alum to permeate the shell and discolor the egg white.

This may look like a regular, innocent egg… but what you cannot see is eggs-actly what makes this egg so special!
How it looks:
Pass a secret message to your friend using this trick. On the outside, the egg looks like any other egg. When the egg is peeled however, a message is remarkably written on the egg inside.
What you need:
• 1 hard-cooked egg (see instructions for hard-cooking an egg below)
• Alum (1 tbsp or 15 mL) (Alum is commonly found at most grocery stores where spices are found.)
• White vinegar (2 cups or 500 mL)
• Fine-tipped paintbrush, toothpick or Q-tip
• Spoon
• Adult helper
Preparation:
Hard-cook one egg. Click here for instructions.
Allow egg to cool. Dissolve alum in vinegar by stirring it with a spoon . Dip a fine-tipped brush, toothpick or Q-tip into the solution and write your secret message on the shell of the egg. When the shell is later removed, the writing will be visible on the egg's surface.
How it works:
The vinegar dissolves the calcium carbonate in the eggshell, allowing the alum to go through (or permeate) the shell and discolor the egg white.
WARNING – DO NOT EAT THIS EGG AFTER THIS TRICK HAS BEEN PERFORMED!
Did you know…
Although alum was used for years in pickling, it is no longer considered safe to do so.

Simon and Schuster, p.43",eng,"The young man was Giambattista della Porta, who was born into wealth and privilege in 1535. From an early age, he was encouraged to acquire knowledge. This meant, firstly, a tour of Europe, with a particular emphasis on acquiring musical skills. Upon his return to the sun-drenched Bay of Naples, aged twenty-two, he began work on the first of many books; this one being Natural Magic, which despite the title was less to do with magic than with ‘the perfection of natural philosophy and the highest science’. He introduced it by explaining that ‘if ever any man laboured earnestly to discover the secrets of Nature, it was I; for with all my mind and power, I have turned over the monuments of our ancestors and if they wrote anything that was secret and concealed, that I enrolled in my catalogue of rarities’. These ‘secrets’ included ‘Of the Causes of Wonderful Things’, ‘Of Beautifying Women’, ‘Of Strange Glasses’, ‘Of Artificial Fires’ and ‘Of Invisible Writing’. His first rather startling entrance into codebreaking was his adaptation of a dairy-based ruse he attributed to a second century Libyan scholar called Africanus and it involved smuggling messages to prisoners via eggs. This might sound whimsical, but this was still the time of the Inquisition, and to be suspected of heresy could be hideously dangerous. Secret messages that made it past the most intensive searches could be life-saving for many prisoners kept in dungeons. But how to avoid this stringent security? The method: write the message, using alum or plant dye, onto the shell of an egg. When the egg is dry, hard-boil it and the message on the shell will disappear. The egg could then be taken into the prison in a package of food. When it arrived, all the recipient had to do was peel the shell and they would find the message there, indelibly imprinted onto the boiled egg white.",,,

Use this as a fun effect for your kids or friends.
Instructions
Difficulty: Moderately Easy
Things You’ll Need:
Alum
Vinegar
Fine Tipped Paint Brush
Stove, Pot and Water
Egg
Step 1 Mix about a ½ ounce of alum with about a ½ pint of vinegar. Mix Well. Keep mixing until the alum is completely (or at least mostly) dissolved in the vinegar.
Step 2 Dip your brush into the solution and write a message on the egg. The writing will spread out slightly, so make your message as fine as possible.
Step 3 Let the egg dry completely. Place under a bright light for 10-15 minutes to speed up the drying process. If you do not let the writing dry completely, that it will just wash off in the next step.
Step 4 Hard boil the egg. No special technique is required. Put your egg in a pot of water. Bring your pot of water to a boil then down to a simmer for 10-15 minutes.
Step 5 Peel the egg to reveal the message (or give to someone else to open).
Step 6 DO NOT EAT THE EGG!!
Tips & Warnings

For me, it seems like a lot of fun to inscribe a message on egg and pass it on to friends with secret messages. Just think how much it would surprise them!
Although we might have grown-up, still this is one idea which we can use to our advantage and have fun with. And what’s more you can also turn it around and have fun with your kids!
Even better, inscribe message on egg and hand it over to your partner to give him/her a loving surprise and to bring some romance back into your lives.
In fact you can also use it as a trick to impress your friends or guests.
To inscribe a message on egg you would need a few simple things like—
Eggs (for sure)
Alum
White vinegar
A fine tip paintbrush or toothpick
A spoon
Well to inscribe message inside an egg just follow these easy instructions and get ready to have some fun.
First of all mix the alum and the white vinegar together really well. Make sure the alum is completely dissolved in the vinegar or at least it is dissolved to the maximum of its capacity before you begin to write message on eggs
Now dipping the brush into the alum and white vinegar solution carefully inscribe message on egg. Just make sure you do not botch up the message while writing so use a fine brush or even toothpick.
After writing message on eggs dry them out completely. Drying the eggs completely is very important because otherwise the chances of the message of being washed out are quite high.
You have to inscribe message on egg, so now the final step is to hard boil the egg. It is not a very difficult task and can be done easily by anyone. Just put the egg in water and bring it to boil for about 15-20 mins. The egg should be hard boiled by then. Just take it out carefully and let it cool.
After the egg cools down, very gently remove the shell without damaging the inside of the egg. And voila! Your very own egg with secret message is ready. You can now give it to someone for reading the inscribe message on egg.
The technique
There is a scientific process behind how this trick works.When you inscribe message on egg with the white vinegar and alum solution, the vinegar dissolves the calcium carbonate of the egg shell. This helps the alum in permeating or going through the shell and discoloring the egg white. Thus whatever you wrote on the egg shell now becomes imprinted on the egg white.
So try this trick today to surprise your loved ones with secret messages delivered in eggs.

Text
A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you . . . and cause you to walk in my statutes  (Ezekiel 36:26-27).
Purpose of the Illustration
To show how Christ can put messages upon the hearts of His children.
To indicate how He can change the heart and give it a living message.
To show how Christ can give us new hearts.
Apparatus
Several fresh eggs, according to the number of messages you wish to write, or objects you wish to draw.
A bottle to contain your writing fluid.
A pen or stubby instrument with which to write or draw.
Some means by which you can boil the eggs before the audience. This may be an electric stove or canned heat. The experiment is more effective if the audience can see it in its entirety. Hence you should boil the eggs before them.
Chemicals
A half pint of vinegar.
An ounce of alum.
Method of Procedure
Dissolve the alum in the vinegar, which is your writing fluid.
Select only fresh and not storage eggs on which to write the various messages, or draw objects, such as a heart, a book, etc. Write such words as God Is Love, Jesus Saves, Salvation by Faith, The Cleansing Blood, Bible, and short Bible verses. Then there may be occasions when you will wish to slant this message toward sinners, and write words such as Cigarettes, Beer, Dance, etc., and draw pictures to suit those words.
With the writing fluid you have prepared write on each egg in view of the audience. It is well to cover the egg with writing. Make the writing as legible as possible.
Boil the eggs fifteen minutes.
Remove the shells and hold the eggs so that the audience can see them. You may wish to pass the eggs around on a platter, or call several young people or children from the audience to read the messages which appear on the boiled eggs.
Chemical Reactions
The writing is invisible on the outside of the
Boiling transfers the messages to the inner surface of the hard-boiled egg, where it is visible.
Cautions and Representations
Do not smear your letters. To do so means a blurred message. Practice the experiment at home until you learn just how to use the solution so it will not run. Be sure that your writing solution is thoroughly dried on the eggs before boiling them.
The egg represents a life or a heart which Christ can change and write His living messages upon.
These messages may be invisible to others, but they are living and flaming within the heart of the converted person.
Russia used this trick to get messages out of forbidden sections during the early days of the revolution. Soviet agents took fresh eggs, wrote the messages which they wished to send upon the eggs, and then shipped them in crates out of the country to the central agent. ""When boiled the eggs revealed the secret messages. Often this was done in code, so if the trick was exposed, the messages were unintelligible to those who exposed them.
Christ has a message which He wants to write upon our hearts. Salvation is primarily a change of heart, and this change brings the written statutes of Christ upon the heart. He places His messages invisibly upon the inner nature, and while others may not be able to see or read or understand them, they are a living force in the life of the Christian.
Since it takes fifteen minutes to boil the eggs you should begin the experiment as soon as you start to talk. On these eggs I am writing an invisible message. As you write the messages call somebody from the audience to inspect the eggs to see if there is any evidence of your writing. There is nothing on the surface of the eggs, is there? Apparently they are ordinary eggs, some brown, some white, some double-yolked (if you are lucky enough to find one!), some large, some small.
When Christ comes in He writes a message upon the heart. Salvation is a heart-experience, and while it cleans up the outer life it works this marvelous change by altering the inner nature. When Christ converts us, He writes His statutes upon our hearts and puts a new spirit within us through the forgiveness of our sins. Only forgiven people, cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, have this experience.
Remove the shells from the egg and read the messages. Here are the results of my writing upon the eggs. This represents the way Christ through the Holy Spirit writes messages upon the hearts of His children.
The messages are plainly evident. How did they get there? I wrote them on the outside, but they developed on the inside. So it is that Christ, when He has given us a new heart through the cleansing of His precious blood, writes on the heart living messages that will cause us to walk in His statutes, and then we ""shall keep (His)  judgments, and do them.""",https://web.archive.org/web/20100209060142/https://moreillustrations.com/chemical%20illustrations/experiment%2020.html,,

Maybe it’s because they are brown. Maybe it’s because they are fresh from the farmer. I’ve found eggs take a lot longer to boil when they are really fresh, something I learned when we kept chickens in our front yard for about eight years. So, the shells of very fresh eggs might be too strong for this experiment. Whatever it is, I could not get today’s experiment to work.
Do You Test All Your Experiments?
I test about three-quarters of the experiments I write about. I look for activities that will be fun with and for grandchildren that meet several criteria:
They are fun
They take 5-10 minutes to complete
You can do them with materials you are likely to have around the house
They have some educational underpinning
Instructions are clear and precise.
If it is something simple, like lining up buttons in a pattern or stacking sugar cubes, I do not do it myself. I just write about it. If, however, I’m not sure if it will work as described, I try it out myself. If it doesn’t work, I look up the concept on the Internet to see if anyone else has a different way that might work. If not, I abandon the activity and look for something else. Freezing water instantly turned out to take a special chemical that only a few sites mentioned. It was not a chemical you would likely have around your house. Getting an oatmeal box to roll with weights suspended inside just never worked. Back To The Eggs and Invisible Writing. This time, I’m writing about it because I think the idea is really cool. I challenge my readers to tell me if they’ve ever tried it, if it worked and what kind of eggs they used. 
Here are the three ways I tried, the first from wackyuses.com: 
Equal Parts Alum and White Vinegar/Boil Egg First
Materials:
Small bowl
Measuring cup
Alum
White vinegar
Q-tips cotton swabs
Hard-boiled egg
Instructions:
Dissolve one part alum in one part vinegar. I used 1 tablespoon of each.
Mix alum and vinegar well.
Dip one of the Q-tips in the alum-vinegar solution.
Write something on the eggshell with the wet Q-tip.
Let the alum-vinegar solution dry on the eggshell.
Peel the egg.
What Should Happen?
The vinegar should dissolve some of the eggshell, allowing the alum through to mark the egg white inside with your message.
I got nothing, no secret message, but the egg was delicious.
Bizarrelabs described the experiment and said sometimes it didn’t work. 
Next: Diluted Alum and White Vinegar/Boil Egg First
Eggs.ab.ca gave a different ratio for the alum and vinegar.
Materials:
Hard-cooked egg
1 Tablespoon alum
2 cups white vinegar
Fine-tipped paintbrush, toothpick or Q-tip.
Instructions:
Hard boil egg; allow to cool
Stir alum into vinegar.
Dip brush, toothpick or Q-tip into the solution and write on the egg
When the egg is later peeled, the message will appear.
This site had the same explanation of what is supposed to be happening.
The vinegar dissolves the calcium carbonate in the eggshell, allowing the alum to go through (permeate) the shell and discolor the egg white.
It also did not work. This site also said you should not eat the egg because alum is no longer considered safe for pickling. It used to be a common ingredient for pickling and that is why you will find  it in the baking section of the grocery store, with other spices. The pickles-and-spices.com site says alum is still approved as a food additive by FDA. But, it can be dangerous in amounts over an ounce and should not be inhaled. It is slowly being withdrawn from use.
Write Before Boiling
Two sites said to write the secret message before hard boiling the eggs.
The Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reprinted a suggestion one of their readers sent in. Using the same diluted alum and vinegar solution to paint on the egg, they suggest waiting several hours after painting the message before boiling the egg. I waited about two hours. No luck.
The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card & Magic Tricks, excerpted in Google books, says to write the name of a card on the egg with the diluted alum-vinegar solution, then boil the egg. Then, arrange to have someone pick that card out of a deck through a magic trick explained elsewhere in the book, crack open the egg and reveal the name of the card they are holding. Now, that would be an impressive trick. Have you ever heard of this secret message inside an egg trick? Have you ever tried it? What kind of eggs did you use?

It is particularly effective with a young audience. Effect: A spectator cuts the pack, remembers a chosen card, and then shuffletsh e card back into the pack. The spectator then shells a previously inspected hard-boiled egg and discovers the name of the chosen card is written on the egg white! Equipment You will need an ordinary pack of playing cards, a fresh egg, half an ounce (15g) of alum (potassium alum), half a pint (300ml) of vinegar, a wooden cocktail stick, a spoon, a saucepan of water and a stove ring. You will need adult supervision when boiling the egg. Preparation: Dissolve the alum (potassium alum) in the vinegar. Write the name of a card (the one you will force) on the eggshell using the cocktail stick dipped in the alum solution. Place this card at the bottom of the pack. When the writing is dry and invisible, boil the egg for 12-15 minutes. Remove the egg from the saucepan with a spoon and allow the egg to cool. It is now ready to use. Throw away the unused solution and thoroughly clean and rinse your hands and the equipment you used. The trick uses the technique in The Cut Force (see p. 128) and the false overhand shuffle (see p. 12). Performing Begin by explaining: “This is one of my most unusual tricks. Have a good look at this hard-boiled egg.” Pass the egg to a spectator to examine carefully. Take back the egg and put it safely to one side. Continue: “Now throughout the trick I want you to keep one eye on the egg.” Shuffle the pack using the false overhand shuffle that keeps the bottom card in place. Get a spectator to cut the cards and put the lower pile crossways on the upper pile. As he does this, say: “Don’t forget to keep an eye on the egg.” Ask the spectator to pick up the top pile, look at and remember the bottom card, and then place the pile on top of the other cards and shuffle the pack thoroughly. Get the spectator to put the pack to one side and then concentrate hard on a mental image of the card he has chosen. As he is doing this, take the egg and pass your hand back and forth over the egg, concentrating hard with your eyes shut. Finish with: “Yes, I think I’ve done it.” Pass the egg to the spectator and ask him to carefully remove the shell. On the egg white will be the name of his card (1)!

Secundo autem transfertur figura ad albi ovi superficiem: omne enim quod actus est particeps, imaginem recipit eius quod actu est, & eam transfert, si non corrumpat.

Pound galls with alum, mix them with vinegar, then write with this liquid whatever you please upon the shell, and when it has dried, place it in brine. Or else coat the egg with wax, and with a stylus inscribe letters so that the wax parts and the letters remain, in which moisture is applied. When the egg is dry, it is boiled until it hardens; then pour over it sharp vinegar. In this way the letters are made penetrable, which, when the shell is removed, you will see in the egg itself. For vinegar softens the shell of the egg, so that it can be thrust into a narrow vessel, but water hardens it. If I set forth the explanation of these two experiments of ours, I will first make the matter itself worthy of investigation, and open the way to discovering other experiments of this kind. That the shell softens by the power of vinegar happens because it has ""pores"" as the Greeks say; for it perspires, therefore it absorbs it. Now vinegar is of a subtle substance, therefore it penetrates into its substance. But since the shell of the egg is congealed by cold and of tender substance, it is dissolved by moisture. Whereas water, because of its excessive coldness, expels what is subtle and moist within its substance and congeals the rest: therefore the eggshell, which had become soft by vinegar, hardens in water. When therefore you have subdued galls and alum with vinegar, the vinegar receives the power of both. Wherefore, when letters are written, the vinegar penetrates inward through the passages of the shell. On the white of the egg the gall leaves a saffron-tinged color. But alum prevents it from being damaged by fire: therefore the color adheres more firmly, whether it be dried in brine—for the form of the letters becomes fixed. Then it is steeped in sharp vinegar, either so that what has been preserved in brine transfers more from the shell into the egg-white, or, if it has been boiled in fire, it draws inward the remnants that remain in the shell. For the first use of the vinegar is that the figure penetrates into the shell, not that the greater part passes all the way into the egg-white, because of the small quantity of vinegar. In the second stage, however, the figure is transferred to the surface of the egg-white. For everything that shares in actuality receives the image of that which is actual, and transmits it, provided it does not corrupt it. The figures are now actually in the shell by means of fire, and vinegar is actually sharp: for it dissolves, as has been shown, the shell of the egg without heat. Therefore vinegar leaves behind the image of the letters, and effaces those which are in the shell so that they are not visible. Accordingly, when you have removed the shell, or when another has imprudently boiled the egg again, because the images are retained by the power of the alum, the letters, once the shell has been stripped off, appear visibly upon the egg.]"

We must now explain by what method writing itself can be imprinted secretly on the shell or on the white of an egg, so that it appears only to one who knows the art. I. How to imprint letters on the shell of an egg and conceal them. Smear a boiled egg with wax, and in this wax inscribe with an iron stylus the letters you wish, right down to the shell (which, however, must not be damaged by the stylus, otherwise the letters will not remain hidden). After this, immerse the egg for a whole night in strong lye. In the morning, remove the wax from the egg. Strip the egg of its shell and hold the shell up to the light: you will see it almost transparent, and the letters shining through. [W64A.v2]The same result, says Porta (Natural Magic, book 16, chapter 4), occurs if you paint the egg with lemon juice, which softens the shell so that it is not harmed, and you may obtain your wish. [W64B]II. How to make letters appear yellow on the white of a boiled egg. Boil an egg until hard, coat it all around with wax, and inscribe letters with a stylus so that the lines split open in the wax and reach down to the shell. Immerse it in a liquid made from galls and alum ground together. Then place the egg in strong vinegar. The letters marked on the shell will be carried in by the vinegar, and when the shell is removed, they will appear on the white. Porta gives the reason: the shell of the egg is porous, and vinegar is subtle, so it penetrates through the pores and makes the shell soft. When the vinegar is mixed with alum and galls, it carries their substance with it and imprints it on the egg white. But note: the egg must not be left too long in vinegar, otherwise it will be entirely eaten away and left bare with only its thin skin. [W64C] III. How to make letters visible in an egg with water. Dissolve copperas or vitriol in water and write with it on the shell; when the letters are dry, boil galls in wine, and immerse the egg in it: the letters will appear. [W64D] Or write on the egg with lime-water, and immerse it in lye in which brazilwood has been soaked: the letters will appear reddish. [W64E]Or write with tallow on the shell, immerse the egg in vitriolated water, then after drying scrape off the tallow and immerse the egg in the said wine: white letters will show up on the blackened shell. [W64F]IV. How to make letters visible on an egg by fire. Write on the shell of an egg with the juice of lemons, capers, or other sharp fruits, or with the milky juice of the fig tree. When the egg is held to the fire, yellow letters will appear.[W64E.v2] If in a raw egg you write with such juice, they will appear when it is boiled. [W64G] V. How to make letters written on the shell of an egg, and invisible, become visible when sprinkled with powder. This is done if you write on the shell with vinegar, fat, fig juice, apple gum, and the like; then, when you sprinkle powdered charcoal, or the ashes of burnt paper or straw, or any other powder, the letters will appear black, or the same colour as the powder. Note: To hide a letter inside an empty egg Besides the method we taught in chapter 4, §4, we may add another. Soak an egg in strong vinegar for three, four, or more hours; and when you find it softened, cut open the shell with a knife, empty the egg, fold up the paper containing the secret, and insert it through the opening. Seal the cut with a mixture of lime and gum. Immerse the egg in cold water and let it soak: soon the shell will be restored to its original hardness. This is enough on the concealment of writing by means of eggs."

On hidden images in an egg Dip an egg in melted wax, and draw an image with a stylus on the shell. Then immerse the egg overnight in lye used for separating gold from silver. When the wax is removed, nothing will appear; but take off the shell, and against the light you will see the image. The same will happen if you paint on the eggshell with lemon juice. But if you want a picture to appear yellow beneath the shell, on the very white of the egg, boil the egg in its shell until it is hard. Then, when it has cooled, dip it into melted wax, and once the wax has hardened, inscribe with a stylus whatever you please. After this, put the egg into a mixture of galls and alum ground together with ordinary water. Then remove it and put it into strong lye: it will turn out as you wish. Or grind galls with alum and vinegar into a thick paste, paint with it instead of colour, and dry it in the sun. The picture will pass onto the white. Then put the egg into strong brine; when you have taken it out, dry it, and boil it in cold water. Once the shell is removed, the image will be visible on the white itself. If you want a picture suddenly to appear on the shell: dissolve vitriol in common water, and with it paint on the shell. Nothing will appear. But if you wash it with wine in which galls have been boiled, the image will appear. Or paint on the shell with lime-water, and to make the image appear, immerse it in lye in which brazilwood has been soaked. Or smear the shell with tallow and draw with a stylus. When it is dipped in vitriolated water nothing will appear; but if it is then dipped in wine in which galls have been boiled, the picture will suddenly emerge, showing white. If, however, you have painted with tallow, then immersed it in the said vitriol and scraped away the tallow, when you immerse the egg in wine, the picture will shine white while the rest of the shell blackens. If you wish to see a yellow picture on the shell of the egg, paint on the shell with the juice of lemons, capers, or fig milk, then hold the shell to the fire. But if you want a black picture to appear with heat, write with sal ammoniac dissolved in water. You can also obtain a picture impressed on the white in this way: Take galls and alum, grind them coarsely with vinegar, and paint the egg. Dry it in the sun, then place it in sharp brine, afterwards remove it and dry it, then boil it in water. When you take off the shell, you will find the picture depicted on the white. Another method: mix oak-galls with vinegar, and with this liquid paint whatever you wish on the shell of the egg. Allow it to dry, then soak the egg for six hours in salt water or vinegar, and afterwards dry it. If you then hold it to the fire, and afterwards remove the shell, the picture will appear on the white of the egg. Another method: cover the egg with wax, and engrave on it the picture with a stylus. Then immerse it in vinegar in which oak-galls have lain for a whole day. Whoever wishes to see the picture must remove the shell.]"

On secret writing by a foreign stylus, or the third general method. The methods have now been dealt with which relate both to the subject (see chapters 2 and 3) and to the material of water (chapters 4 and 5). What remains is the method of concealment that depends on a “foreign stylus.” For the usual instruments of writing are the reed and the quill. Foreign to these are when we use an iron stylus, or even draw letters with the finger. But you must know that these instruments alone are not enough to produce hidden writing, unless other factors are also combined, as we shall explain. If an iron stylus is to be used for hidden writing, then, following Porta (Natural Magic, book 16, chapter 4, p. 64), the procedure is as follows: First smear the egg with wax, and with an iron stylus draw letters down to the shell. Then a mixture of vinegar and galls is applied, so that the cracks are filled and dried. The egg is kept in vinegar for a day. When the wax is removed, it is sent to the recipient. When he boils and cleans it, he will find the characters impressed into the shell and onto the hard white of the egg. (Porta adds in the same place: the same will happen if you paint the eggshell with lemon juice, which softens the shell so that it is not spoiled, and you may obtain your wish.) If you wish the letters to appear yellow on the white of the egg, proceed more carefully: boil the egg until hard, cover it with wax, and inscribe letters with the stylus so that the cuts split open. Immerse it in a liquid made from ground galls and alum. Then put it into sharp vinegar, and those penetrable letters will be carried through, which, when the shell is removed, you will see on the egg white. Africanus teaches the following: Grind galls and alum with vinegar until they have the thickness of ink. With this write whatever you like on the egg. Once the writing has dried in the sun, immerse the egg in strong brine. When it is dried, boiled, and shelled, you will find the inscription. I tried placing an egg in vinegar and nothing happened—unless by “brine” he means strong lye, commonly called “capitellum.” The cause is this: the shell of the egg is porous and has open channels, as shown by the fact that a freshly laid egg sweats and water trickles from it, and when you hold it up to the light it appears translucent. Since vinegar is subtle, it penetrates through and softens the shell. When mixed with alum and galls it carries their substance with it and imprints it on the white. If you then immerse the egg in cold water, it hardens again and returns to its former state. But note: it must not be left too long in vinegar, for it will completely erode the shell, leaving the egg bare and covered only by the thin skin. If it is then immersed in water, the shell will not return. Although the preceding properly belongs under chapter 4, since we are speaking here of methods of writing in eggs, we may add others. The first, reported also by Porta (Natural Magic 16.4), is when letters written on an egg are revealed by powder. This is done in the following way: write notes on the shell with vinegar, fat, fig milk, spurge, or gum. When you wish them to be visible, dust with powdered charcoal, or the ashes of burnt paper or straw, and the letters will appear black. The second method, in which letters written on the egg become visible with water, is taught by Porta in the same place. Dissolve copperas in water and write on the shell; when it dries, nothing will be seen. If you then boil galls in wine and immerse the egg in it, the letters will immediately appear. Or write with lime-water on the egg and immerse it in lye in which brazilwood has been soaked: the letters will appear reddish. Or write with tallow on the shell and immerse it in vitriolated water; nothing will appear. But if you scrape off the tallow and immerse the egg in the said wine, the letters will appear white on the blackened shell. The third method, by which letters written on an egg become visible with fire, is given by Porta in the same place. If you write on the egg with lemon juice, the juice of capers, or fig milk, and then hold it to the fire, you will see yellow letters. The same can be done with a raw egg, and when it is boiled, the letters will appear."

Je l’ai trouvée dans une chemise cartonnée contenant les notes manuscrites qu’un magicien très âgé m’avait données avant de quitter ce monde. Il s’appelait Mr Borges. Préparation : Achetez chez votre pharmacien de l’ALUN (prix 1998 : 11,70 F). Il s’agit d’une poudre que l’on utilise pour fabriquer une solution pour tanner les peaux de bête. Faites une solution de ce produit dans les proportions suivantes : 45 gr d’Alun en poudre + 90 gr de vinaigre d’alcool. Soit une mesure d’Alun pour 2 mesures de vinaigre d’alcool. Après dissolution, prenez un pinceau ou un morceau de bois appointé et écrivez sur la coquille le message que vous souhaitez faire apparaître.Laissez sécher pendant une douzaine d’heures au soleil ou à proximité d’un radiateur. Puis faites bouillir l’œuf pendant 15 minutes et laissez le refroidir. Votre œuf est prêt. En ce qui concerne la sélection des cartes, il s’agit exactement du même principe que celui de la routine qui se trouve page 66 (l’Europe des douze). Nous l’avons adapté ici avec 6 cartes vieillies. Toutes les cartes portent à leur dos le nom de DRANNOC et la carte DRANNOC porte, au dos, le dessin d’un œuf. Pour le reste, le modus operandi est exactement le même.Petite recommandation : lorsque vous achetez de l’ALUN, si le pharmacien vous demande si vous avez une marque favorite, dites-lui la marque DELON (Alun Delon). Quelle belle vie !... L’Avis du Professeur Cabrol: La rédaction m’a transmis la lettre d’un lecteur qui n’est pas parvenu à écrire sur le blanc d’un œuf à travers la coquille en suivant les indications données dans l’article qui précède. Il nous précise que : 1. l’Alun se présente en granules très fins et non en poudre. 2. il ne se dissout pas dans le vinaigre d’alcool. Voici ce qu’il en est : 1. Effectivement l’Alun se présente souvent en cristaux. On peut réduire ces cristaux en poudre fine dans un mortier en porcelaine ou, pour ceux qui n’ont pas accès à un laboratoire, dans un cendrier creux à l’aide du dos d’une petite cuillère. 2.

Popular superstition held that such eggs should be destroyed. The text then shifts to eggshells more broadly, noting that breaking the shell after eating a soft-boiled egg was once a serious matter: originally a magical precaution, it later became mere custom. Historical sources recount how magicians supposedly inscribed characters on eggshells for spells, and why hosts insisted shells be broken to prevent malevolent reuse. The author cites an old recipe (from La Maison rustique, 1775 edition, t.1, p.110, ed. 1775) for writing on eggshells with invisible ink made of gall nuts, alum, and vinegar. The writing becomes visible after cooking the egg in brine. Other uses of eggshells are described: hung to ward off flies, used to protect vegetables and fruit trees from aphids and caterpillars, even pierced and blown empty for collections or carnival cakes. Folklore also attributed to empty shells strange powers, such as floating skyward like balloons when filled with dew. The chapter closes by noting that however magical shells may seem, yolks and whole eggs have even more wondrous properties, leading into Chapter III.]",

Wrap the Egg in wax, and with an iron point make letters on it, as far as to the shell; but break it not: for if you break the shell with your iron, or point, or knife, it may be detected. Soak your Egg one night in strong water of depart, which separates gold from silver: in the morning take away the wax, and take off the Egg-shell’s cover, and hold the shell between your eye and the light, and the letters will be seen very clear quite through the transparent shell. [W76a.v2]The same is done with the juice of Lemmons: for it softeneth the shell; but spoil it not, and you shall have your desire. Will you [W76b] That letters may be seen upon the white yellow, and better when the Egg is boyl’d.

[W76c] — Africanus teacheth it thus: Grind galls and alom with vinegar, till they be as thick as ink: with this write what you will on an Egg; and when the writing is dried in the Sun, put it into sharp pickle: dry it, boyl it, and take off the shell, and you shall read the writing. I put it into vinegar, and could do nothing of it. Perhaps he means by pickle, capital lees. The cause is this: the Egg-shell is porous, and hath large holes, which is plain; for being set to the fire, it will sweat, and water will come forth; and looking at it against the light, it will shew clear: so then, vinegar being subtle, penetrates by the pores, and makes the shell tender: and when it is mingled with the Alom & Galls, it carrieth their substance with it, and makes them appear on the white; and when it is put into cold water, it is condensed, and comes to be hard as it was. But observe, it must not stay long in vinegar; for that will eat off all the shell, and will leave the Egg bare, having nothing but a thin skin to cover it: and if you put that into cold water, the shell will not come again.",https://archive.org/details/naturalmagick00port/page/342/mode/2up,,

One and  another method of writing letters and marking images on the outer shell of a raw egg, which soon appear on the surface of the white inside, once the egg has been boiled until hardened and the shell removed. [W82a] First I will show this: take as much rock alum as you like, grind it, and dissolve it in sharp vinegar. With this, write letters on the outer shell of a raw egg. Then expose it to the sun until the writing is dried. Afterwards immerse the egg in sea water, or in some other very well-salted water, whether naturally so or prepared by art, or immerse it in vinegar for three or four days. Then take it out and allow it to dry completely on its own. Finally, boil it in fire until hardened. When at last it is boiled and the shell is removed, then  the letters, or images, or whatever else was marked on the shell will be revealed clearly in the hardened white. [W82b] Another method is this: cover the egg all around, thickly and carefully, with wax. Then with a stylus or bronze pen write letters in the wax, cutting through the wax down to the shell of the egg, and inscribe whatever shapes you like. Once the figures have been made sufficiently broad, fill the incised lines with liquid mixed with salt and alum. Afterwards place the egg thus prepared in vinegar for a full natural day. When this time has passed, remove the egg and thoroughly wipe off the wax. Then in the bare egg the letters, or whatever figures had been inscribed, will appear most beautifully.]"
